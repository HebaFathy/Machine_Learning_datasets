I examined the decision tree learning algorithm ID3 and implement this algorithm using R programming. We first implement basic ID3 in which we dealt with the target function that has discrete output values. We extend the domain of ID3 to real-valued output, such as numeric data and discrete outcome rather than simply Boolean value. Another type of complicated trees has been tested to allow using various kinds of data. The report includes testing some of regression trees like CART and C4.5 which is already built on R libraries to be able to deal with continuous data. 
Applying J48 and ID3 on smaller dataset (soybeans). 
Using larger dataset such as Nursery dataset by applying tree and rpart, Pima dataset by applying naive and rpart.
